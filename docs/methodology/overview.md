Overview of Methodology

This study applies a Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) framework to evaluate the potential human health risks associated with the consumption of untreated water from UNESCO-registered Persian qanats contaminated with *Escherichia coli*. The methodology follows internationally accepted QMRA guidelines and integrates field measurements, laboratory analyses, deterministic calculations, and probabilistic modeling to provide a comprehensive assessment of infection and illness risks.

The overall analytical workflow consists of four standard QMRA components: (i) hazard identification, (ii) exposure assessment, (iii) dose–response assessment, and (iv) risk characterization. These components were implemented sequentially and consistently across all studied qanats and for both wet and dry groundwater seasons.

Field campaigns were conducted to collect water samples from eleven UNESCO-registered qanats distributed across different hydrogeological and climatic regions of Iran. Microbiological analyses were performed using standardized membrane filtration techniques to quantify *E. coli* concentrations, which were expressed as most probable number per 100 mL (MPN/100 mL). These measurements formed the primary input data for subsequent risk calculations.

Deterministic (point-estimate) risk assessment was first performed to provide baseline estimates of daily and annual probabilities of infection and illness. This step relied on representative average values of exposure parameters and fixed dose–response coefficients, enabling direct comparison with international health-based targets, including the World Health Organization (WHO) benchmark of 1.0×10⁻⁴ infections per person per year.

To overcome the inherent limitations of point-estimate approaches and to explicitly represent variability and uncertainty, a probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation framework was subsequently implemented. The primary Monte Carlo analysis propagated variability in *E. coli* concentration, drinking water ingestion volume, and exposure frequency through the QMRA model using 10,000 iterations. This resulted in probability distributions of annual infection risk for each qanat and season, allowing characterization of central tendencies and upper-tail risk behavior.

In addition, a secondary Monte Carlo analysis was conducted to explore biological uncertainty associated with the dose–response relationship. In this supplementary analysis, the parameters of the β-Poisson dose–response model (α and N₅₀) were treated as stochastic variables rather than fixed constants, thereby accounting for uncertainty in pathogen infectivity and host response. The results of this secondary analysis are documented separately to ensure transparency while maintaining consistency with the primary objectives of the study.

The computational workflow was implemented using a combination of software tools, each serving a distinct role. Microsoft Excel was used for data preprocessing, quality control, and deterministic calculations. Python was employed for probabilistic simulations, uncertainty propagation, and sensitivity analysis. SPSS was applied for descriptive statistical analysis and hypothesis testing where appropriate. This modular structure ensures reproducibility, clarity, and traceability between raw data, processed inputs, and final risk estimates.

Together, this integrated methodological framework provides a robust and transparent basis for evaluating microbial health risks in historical qanat systems, supporting both scientific interpretation and evidence-based decision-making for groundwater management and public health protection.
