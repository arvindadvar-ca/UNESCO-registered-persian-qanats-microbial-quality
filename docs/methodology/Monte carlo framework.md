Monte Carlo Simulation Framework

Deterministic (point-estimate) microbial risk assessments provide useful baseline estimates; however, they do not capture the inherent variability in environmental measurements or uncertainty associated with model inputs. To address this limitation, a probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation framework was implemented to propagate variability and uncertainty through the QMRA model and to quantify the distribution of potential health risks.

For each qanat and for both wet and dry seasons, 10,000 Monte Carlo iterations were performed. In each iteration, key QMRA input parameters—including *E. coli* concentration, daily drinking water ingestion volume, and annual exposure frequency—were randomly sampled from predefined probability distributions. These sampled inputs were used to calculate an event-based ingested dose, which was subsequently translated into a daily probability of infection using the β-Poisson dose–response model described previously.

Annual probabilities of infection were derived by propagating the daily infection probability across the sampled number of exposure days per year. Repeating this process over all iterations resulted in distributions of annual infection risk for each qanat–season combination, thereby allowing characterization of central tendencies as well as higher-end risk behavior.

Microbial concentrations of *E. coli* were modeled using log-normal distributions, reflecting the well-documented right-skewed nature of environmental microbial data and their tendency to span multiple orders of magnitude. Daily drinking water ingestion volume was also represented by a log-normal distribution with a median value of 2.0 L/day, consistent with values reported in the QMRA literature. Annual exposure frequency was sampled from log-normal distributions centered on site-specific median values derived from field-based questionnaires, reflecting continuous, seasonal, or intermittent use patterns of qanat water.

In the primary Monte Carlo analysis, the β-Poisson dose–response parameters (α and N₅₀) were treated as fixed values adopted from controlled human feeding trials reported in the literature. This approach was selected to maintain consistency with established QMRA practice and because previous studies have shown that variability in environmental microbial concentrations generally dominates overall risk uncertainty relative to dose–response parameter uncertainty.

To ensure methodological completeness and transparency, a supplementary secondary Monte Carlo analysis was conducted in which biological uncertainty in the dose–response relationship was explicitly considered. In this analysis, α and N₅₀ were modeled as probabilistic variables using truncated log-normal distributions informed by reported uncertainty ranges in the QMRA literature. Results of this secondary analysis are provided separately (Supplementary Information) and are not used as the primary basis for regulatory or comparative risk interpretation.

Probabilistic risk outputs were summarized using descriptive statistics, including the mean, median, and 5th–95th percentiles (P5–P95) of the simulated annual infection risk distributions. These metrics were used to characterize overall uncertainty and to identify plausible upper-bound risk scenarios relevant to public health protection.
