Uncertainty and Limitations

Despite providing valuable insight into the occurrence of *Escherichia coli* in UNESCO-registered qanat systems and the associated public health risks, several sources of uncertainty and limitation should be acknowledged when interpreting the results of this study.

First, the number of microbiological sampling events was limited, particularly with respect to capturing fine-scale seasonal and temporal variability. Although samples were collected during both wet and dry periods, short-term fluctuations driven by recharge events, rainfall, and changes in local water use patterns may not have been fully represented. As a result, the estimated risk distributions may not encompass the complete range of possible contamination scenarios.

Second, the risk assessment focused exclusively on *E. coli* as the primary microbial indicator. While *E. coli* is widely used as an indicator of fecal contamination and microbial water quality, the presence of other pathogenic microorganisms—such as *Enterococci*, *Salmonella* spp., *Shigella* spp., *Campylobacter* spp., and enteric viruses (e.g., norovirus)—could also influence the suitability of qanat water for drinking purposes. The exclusion of pathogen-specific assessments may therefore lead to underestimation of overall health risks in some settings.

Additional uncertainty arises from assumptions embedded within the QMRA framework, including exposure volumes, dose–response relationships, and environmental conditions affecting pathogen survival and transport. Although probabilistic modeling was employed to represent variability in key exposure parameters, residual uncertainty remains due to limited site-specific data and reliance on literature-derived values for certain model inputs.

Recognizing these limitations, future research should prioritize more extensive and higher-frequency sampling campaigns across multiple seasons to better characterize temporal dynamics of microbial contamination in qanat systems. Incorporation of multiple microbial indicators and pathogen-specific QMRA analyses would improve the robustness and comprehensiveness of health risk estimates. Furthermore, integration of hydrological modeling with microbial monitoring data could enhance understanding of contamination sources, transport pathways, and attenuation processes within qanat systems, thereby supporting more effective risk management and protection of public health.
