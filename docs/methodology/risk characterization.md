Risk Characterization

Risk characterization integrates the outputs of the exposure assessment and the dose–response model to estimate the probability of infection and illness associated with consumption of untreated qanat water. In this study, risk was quantified at both daily and annual time scales to enable comparison with international health-based benchmarks.

The daily probability of infection (*P{inf,day}*) was obtained by applying the β-Poisson dose–response model to the ingested microbial dose calculated for each exposure event. To extrapolate infection risk from the daily to the annual scale, the number of exposure days per year (*n*) was explicitly considered according to:

[
*P{inf,annual}* = 1 - [1 - *P{inf,day}*]^(*n*)
]

where (*n*) represents the annual frequency of qanat water consumption.

The annual probability of illness (*P{ill,annual}*) was subsequently estimated by multiplying the annual infection probability by the conditional probability of illness given infection:

[
*P{ill,annual}* = *P{inf,annual}* * *P{ill/inf}*
]

In the absence of site-specific morbidity data, the probability of illness given infection (*P{ill/inf}*) was assumed to be 0.25 for *E. coli*, consistent with values reported in the literature.

Annual exposure frequency was derived from field observations and structured questionnaires administered to local users, which revealed substantial heterogeneity in qanat water usage patterns. To reflect realistic consumption behavior and to avoid systematic overestimation of risk, qanats were classified into three exposure categories based on the intensity of domestic use: (i) main-use (365 days per year, continuous use as the primary drinking water source), (ii) seasonal-use (180 days per year, primary source during part of the year), and (iii) intermittent or occasional use (60 days per year, limited or non-domestic use). This classification accounts for seasonal variability, accessibility, and the availability of alternative water sources across study sites.

Calculated annual probabilities of infection and illness were compared against the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline value of 1.0 × 10⁻⁴ infections per person per year, which represents an acceptable level of microbial risk for drinking water safety. This comparison enabled identification of qanats and seasons associated with elevated public health risk and provided a consistent basis for interpretation across deterministic and probabilistic analyses.
