Processed datasets derived from raw groundwater quality measurements.

This folder contains datasets generated through transformation of measured concentrations into exposure-related variables used in microbial risk assessment. Processing steps included:

- Conversion of E. coli concentrations to ingested microbial dose based on water consumption rates
- Preparation of exposure input variables for probabilistic (Monte Carlo) risk assessment
- Seasonal classification of exposure datasets (wet and dry periods)
- Correlation analysis between probabilistic risk outputs and contributing exposure variables

A daily drinking water ingestion rate of 2 L/day was applied uniformly to all samples based on WHO guidelines. This value represents an assumed exposure parameter and was used solely for the calculation of ingested microbial dose.

No data cleaning or removal of observations was performed; all transformations were applied directly to the raw measurements.
