Processed datasets derived from raw groundwater quality measurements.

This folder contains datasets generated through transformation of measured concentrations into exposure-related variables used in microbial risk assessment. Processing steps included:
- Conversion of E. coli concentrations to ingested microbial dose based on water consumption rates
- Preparation of exposure input variables for probabilistic (Monte Carlo) risk assessment
- Seasonal classification of exposure datasets (wet and dry periods)
- Correlation analysis between probabilistic risk outputs and contributing exposure variables

No data cleaning or removal of observations was performed; all transformations were applied directly to the raw measurements.
