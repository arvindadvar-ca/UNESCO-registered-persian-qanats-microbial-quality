Processed groundwater quality datasets derived from the raw measurements.

This folder contains datasets that were prepared for statistical analysis and microbial health risk assessment. Data processing steps included:
- Quality control and removal of missing or inconsistent records
- Unit standardization of physicochemical and microbial parameters
- Seasonal classification of samples into wet and dry periods
- Log-transformation of E. coli concentrations where required
- Preparation of input datasets for health risk assessment and Monte Carlo simulation
- Correlation analysis between probabilistic risk outputs and input variables to evaluate parameter influence and sensitivity

All processed datasets were generated from the raw data using the scripts provided in the `scripts/` directory.
