This folder contains SPSS output files from the correlation analysis.

Correlation analyses were conducted on probabilistic (Monte Carlo) risk assessment outputs to examine relationships between risk estimates and model variables under multiple analysis scenarios. The SPSS Viewer file explicitly reports the applied statistical methods, variables, and analysis settings for all cases.

SPSS syntax files are not available, as the analysis was conducted prior to repository preparation.
