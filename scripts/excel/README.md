This folder contains Microsoft Excel files used for data transformation and deterministic microbial risk assessment.

Excel was used to:
- Transform raw groundwater quality data into exposure-related variables
- Convert E. coli concentrations to ingested microbial dose based on an assumed daily water consumption rate
- Perform deterministic microbial risk assessment calculations

These Excel files were used for data preparation and deterministic analysis only. Probabilistic (Monte Carlo) simulations and correlation analyses were conducted using other software tools.
