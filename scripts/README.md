Scripts used for data processing, statistical analysis, and health risk assessment.

This folder includes codes developed to:
- Clean and preprocess raw groundwater quality data
- Perform descriptive and comparative statistical analyses
- Conduct microbial risk assessment calculations
- Implement Monte Carlo simulations to account for variability and uncertainty

All scripts are documented and can be used to reproduce the results presented in the manuscript.
