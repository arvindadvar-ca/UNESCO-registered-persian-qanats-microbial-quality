This folder contains Python scripts used for probabilistic microbial risk assessment.

Python was used to:
- Perform Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 iterations) to account for variability and uncertainty
- Generate probabilistic risk distributions based on deterministic exposure inputs
- Export simulation outputs for further analysis

All Python scripts read input data from the `data/processed` directory and write results to the `results` directory.
