This directory contains all figures associated exclusively with the Results section of the manuscript.

The figures illustrate key outcomes of the quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) framework applied to *Escherichia coli* contamination in UNESCO-registered Persian qanats. They collectively present measured microbial water quality, deterministic risk estimates, probabilistic risk distributions, sensitivity analysis results, and risk classification based on international health standards.

All figures are provided as high-resolution PNG files to ensure visual consistency with the published manuscript. No raw data, simulation code, or intermediate analytical outputs are included in this directory.

Contents:

Seasonal *E. coli* concentrations in qanat drinking water (wet vs. dry seasons) compared against the World Health Organization microbial safety guideline (<1 MPN/100 mL)

Deterministic point-estimate results for daily infection probability, annual infection probability, and annual illness probability

Probabilistic annual infection risk distributions derived from primary Monte Carlo simulations for wet and dry seasons

Spearman rank correlation analysis identifying the relative influence of QMRA input parameters on annual infection probability

Risk categorization of E. coli contamination across studied qanats based on WHO health risk thresholds

Each figure is referenced and described in detail within the Results section of the manuscript.
