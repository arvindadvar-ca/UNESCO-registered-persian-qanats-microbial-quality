This directory contains all tables associated exclusively with the Results section
of the manuscript.

The tables summarize descriptive water quality results as well as deterministic
and probabilistic quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) outputs for
Escherichia coli in UNESCO-registered Persian qanats.

All tables are provided as high-resolution PNG files to ensure consistency with
the published manuscript. No raw or intermediate datasets are included in this
directory.

Contents:
- Physicochemical parameters and seasonal E. coli concentrations (wet and dry periods)
- Comparison of deterministic and probabilistic annual infection risk estimates
- Statistical evaluation of annual infection risks against the WHO guideline value
  (10⁻⁴ infections per person per year)
